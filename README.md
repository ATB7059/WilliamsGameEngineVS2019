# Game Engine Tutorial
*Mr. Miyoshi’s Beginning Programming / Game Programming Class*

This tutorial will walk you through the process of creating your own game, starting with a barebones project and building up to a 
complete game with user input, game objects, collisions, and more. Along the way we’ll explore each piece of the game in-depth. 
After working through this tutorial you’ll be able to use the skills you’ve learned to make any kind of game you’d like.

See Game Engine Tutorial.pdf for a full step-by-step tutorial.
